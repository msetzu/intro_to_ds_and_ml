# Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning
Material for the Ph.D. course at [University of Macerata](https://www.unimc.it/it/dottorato-di-ricerca/corsi-di-dottorato/corsi-di-dottorato-ciclo-xxxvi/corso-di-dottorato-quantitative-methods-for-policy-evaluation).

## Quick start
You will need to install the following software utilities.


| Utility | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | `3.10` or up. Avoid `3.13` |

`pip` packages are installed trough [pip](https://pypi.org), a package manager that allows us to import useful tools and code written by other developers.
You can find [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) a guideline on how to install `pip`.
Note that `pip` is used through the command line, i.e., the "command prompt" on Windows OSs, or the "Terminal" in Mac OS/Linux (Unix) OSs.
Alternatively, you can use `pip` directly from a Jupyter notebook, which in turn can be installed even without `pip` (through `brew` if you use Mac OS/Linux).
On Windows prepend the installation command with `py -m`.

In the following table you find some packages of interest which will be useful for the course.
Copy-Paste the installation commands on your command line, press Enter, and let the installation run through.
You will see several lines of text appear, it's safe to ignore them.

| Utility | Version | Command |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| [sklearn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)     | `latest` | `pip install scikit-learn` |

| [datasets](https://pypi.org/project/datasets/)        | `latest` | `pip install datasets` |
| [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)    | `latest` | `pip install matplotlib` |
| [notebook](https://pypi.org/project/notebook/)        | `latest` | `pip install notebook` |
